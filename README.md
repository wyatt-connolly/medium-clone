# :pencil: Lessons

After hearing all the hype about typescript, I decided to hop on the train and learn it while building a blog site. While there is an initial setup creating types and interfaces, not seeing bugs on console and knowing your code works makes up for it. I see this being very useful in the future when installing npm modules that have typescript functionality. This way, I spend less time looking up related modules/values and suggestions are easier. 

I've built my ecommerce site with Sanity, so I am familiar with the technology. ISR is included in the [slug].tsx file to update the page without rebuilding the whole site.

# Local Development

After intalling all dependencies (npm i) run this command:

 `npm run dev`

This will start both server and client in dev mode. The app is now available on localhost:3000.
